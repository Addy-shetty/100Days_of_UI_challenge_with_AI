# 🎨 100 Days of UI Challenge with AI

Welcome to my 100 Days of UI Challenge! This repository documents my journey of creating 100 unique user interface designs over 100 days, leveraging AI assistance and modern web technologies.

## 📖 About the Challenge

This challenge is a personal commitment to:
- Design and code one UI component/page every day for 100 days
- Share each creation on [CodePen](https://codepen.io) for community feedback
- Learn and experiment with different UI/UX patterns, animations, and interactions
- Utilize AI tools to enhance creativity and problem-solving
